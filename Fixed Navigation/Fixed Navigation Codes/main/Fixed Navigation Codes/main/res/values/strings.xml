    <string name="what_is_it">Information Technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking devices, and other infrastructure to create, process, store, secure, and exchange electronic data.</string>
    <string name="history_of_it">
        The history of Information Technology (IT) began in the mid-20th century with the invention of the first electronic computers. Early innovations were driven by the need to solve complex mathematical and military problems during World War II, leading to groundbreaking machines like the ENIAC and UNIVAC.\n\n
        In the 1950s and 60s, mainframe computers were introduced, revolutionizing data processing in businesses, government agencies, and large institutions. These powerful machines required specialized environments and were operated by trained personnel, marking the rise of professional IT roles.\n\n
        The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s sparked a major shift. Personal computers (PCs) like the Apple II and IBM PC brought computing power to homes, schools, and small businesses, making technology more accessible to the general public.\n\n
        In the 1990s, the internet transformed communication and information sharing on a global scale. Email, websites, and online services created new industries, reshaped commerce, and connected people in unprecedented ways.\n\n
        Since the 2000s, IT has rapidly evolved with the explosion of mobile devices, cloud computing, big data analytics, cybersecurity innovations, and artificial intelligence. Technologies like smartphones, social media platforms, and virtual collaboration tools have become integral to daily life and business operations.\n\n
        Today, IT plays a central role in nearly every industry, driving advancements in healthcare, education, finance, entertainment, and beyond. The field continues to innovate with emerging trends such as quantum computing, blockchain technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring that IT remains a dynamic and essential force in shaping the future.
